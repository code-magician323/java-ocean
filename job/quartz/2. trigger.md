## trigger

### introduce

1. The trigger must have unique withIdentity, it's to say, cannot has same name and group-name at same time.
2. Many Triggers can point to the same Job detail, but a single Trigger can only point to one Job detail.
3. Cannot point more triggers to job-detail according to `scheduler.scheduleJob(jobDetail, trigger);`, and should use `scheduler.scheduleJob(trigger2);`
4. Only triggered job-detail can use this way for another trigger: `scheduler.scheduleJob(trigger2);`

2. `*` means match any value
3. `?` just can be used in `day, week`, means it donot what's value. such as `* * * 15 * ? *` it's not clearly *what day of the week* is the 15th of each month

   - 这个 `?` 表示不确定的值, 比如上面的例子中 不确定每个月的 15 号是星期几, 所以就写 `?` 里表示星期不参与[星期无关]

4. `-` is range:
   - `5-10 * * * * ? *`: Execute every 5-10 seconds every minute， 6 times.

5. `,` is specified multi value
   - `5,10,11 * * * * ? *`: Execute every 5, 10, 11 seconds every minute， 3 times.

6. `/`: used to specify increments.

    - `1/5 * * * * ? *`: Execute from 1s[excute], and each 5s will execute.
    - `0/5 * * * * ? *` is same as `*/5 * * * * ? *`: Execute from 0s[excute], and each 5s will execute.
